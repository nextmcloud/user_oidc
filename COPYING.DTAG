Although this Nextcloud app code is free and available under the AGPL3 license, Deutsche Telekom 
(including T-Systems) fully reserves all rights to the Telekom brand. To prevent users from getting confused about
the source of a digital product or experience, there are stringent restrictions on using the Telekom brand and design,
even when built into code that we provide. For any customization other than explicitly for Telekom or T-Systems, you must
replace the Deutsche Telekom and T-Systems brand elements contained in the provided sources.
